Adidas Sales Performance Dashboard (2020–2021)

##Problem Statement  
Adidas needed data-driven insights to evaluate product performance, sales trends, and profitability across different regions, cities, and sales channels over a 3-year period. Without a clear visual analysis, strategic decision-making was limited.

##  Objective  
To analyze Adidas sales data from 2020 to 2022 and create an interactive Excel dashboard that highlights:
- Product-wise sales performance  
- Monthly sales trends  
- Regional and city-wise sales distribution  
- Sales method comparison  
- Retailer performance  
- Profitability metrics and KPIs

## Dashboard Features  
This dashboard was developed using Microsoft Excel and includes:
-  Total Sales by Product  
-  Monthly Sales Trend (2020–2021)  
-  Sales by Sales Method  
-  Sales by Region and Retailer  
-  Average Operating Margin  
-  Top City by Sales  
-  KPI Cards and Interactive Slicers for dynamic filtering

##  Key Observations  
- Footwear led as the top-selling product category.  
- Online sales consistently outperformed retail and outlet methods.  
- The South and West regions generated the highest revenues.  
- A handful of retailers dominated overall sales.  
- Peak sales occurred in Q4 of 2021.

## Recommendations  
- Increase stock and promotion for high-demand products (especially footwear and apparel).  
- Strengthen online platforms and digital marketing strategies.  
- Scale operations in high-performing regions and cities.  
- Evaluate and optimize low-margin products for better profitability.

##  Conclusion  
This project delivered an insightful sales dashboard that enables Adidas to identify trends, evaluate performance, and make strategic decisions backed by data. The visualizations simplify complex datasets into digestible, actionable insights.
